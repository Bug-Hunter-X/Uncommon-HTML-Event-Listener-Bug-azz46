This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to event listeners in HTML.  The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from not using the standard `addEventListener` method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or prevent the event listener from working properly.  This is especially problematic for advanced event handling and multiple listeners.   Learn more about proper event handling techniques in HTML.
